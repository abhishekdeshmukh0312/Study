1.why we override clone method?
-We can't call object class clone method using object class reference from child class which is not in the java.lang package.
thats why we overrride clone method and and call super.clone

2.JVM JDK JRE?JVM architecture?
	JDK – Java Development Kit (in short JDK) is Kit which provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program. JDK is a kit(or package) which includes two things
            Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
			(an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.)

            JRE (to execute your java program).

    Note : JDK is only used by Java Developers.
    JRE – Java Runtime Environment (to say JRE) is an installation package which provides environment to only run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by them who only wants to run the Java Programs i.e. end users of your system.
    JVM – Java Virtual machine(JVM) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java program line by line hence it is also known as interpreter.

3.shutdown hook?
The shutdown hook can be used to perform cleanup resource or save the state when JVM shuts down normally or abruptly. Performing clean resource means closing log file, sending some alerts or something else. So if you want to execute some code before JVM shuts down, use shutdown hook.
The JVM shuts down when:
	user presses ctrl+c on the command prompt
    System.exit(int) method is invoked
    user logoff
    user shutdown etc.
Ex:
	main()
	{
		Runtime r=Runtime.getRuntime();  
		r.addShutdownHook(new MyThread());   //  In Run Method of MyThread class we can perform cleanup resource
	}

5.CPP vs JAVA
	Platform-independent
	system/application programming
	multiple inheritance
	supports pointers / Java supports pointer internally. But you can't write the pointer program in java. It means java has restricted pointer support in java.
	Call by Value and Call by reference / call by value
	C++ doesn't support documentation comment.	Java supports documentation comment (/** ... */)
	Virtual Keyword	C++ supports virtual keyword so that we can decide whether or not override a function.	Java has no virtual keyword. We can override all non-static methods by default. In other words, non-static methods are virtual by default.

15. can we clone the objects using clone method without implementing clonable interface?
No.

16.difference between :list l new arraylist vs arraylist l new arraylist

:The main reason you'd do this is to decouple your code from a specific implementation of the interface. When you write your code like this:

List list = new ArrayList();  

the rest of your code only knows that data is of type List, which is preferable because it allows you to switch between different implementations of the List interface with ease.

For instance, say you were writing a fairly large 3rd party library, and say that you decided to implement the core of your library with a LinkedList. If your library relies heavily on accessing elements in these lists, then eventually you'll find that you've made a poor design decision; you'll realize that you should have used an ArrayList (which gives O(1) access time) instead of a LinkedList (which gives O(n) access time). Assuming you have been programming to an interface, making such a change is easy. You would simply change the instance of List from,

List list = new LinkedList();
to
List list = new ArrayList();

23.What is the difference between "text" and new String("text")? vs StringBuffer? use of intern method

String literal = "abc"; String object = new String("abc").intern(); 
		 System.out.println(literal == object); // true
		 
		 String literal = "abc"; String object = new String("abc"); 
		 System.out.println(literal == object); // false
